# otel-s3m-example

Example otel configuration for S3M

This configuration demonstrates config file organization and component naming conventions for configurations
generated for the S3M flow.

It contains a [common.yaml](common.yaml) file with the base configuration applied when installing the Sumo OT distro,
and two additional integrations defined in the [integrations](integrations) directory - for Apache and MySQL.

We also have a [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) for easier setup.

## Requirements

You need docker and docker-compose installed and an install token generated by Sumo.

## Running the example

Put your install token in an environment variable:

```bash
export INSTALL_TOKEN=...
```

and start docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

That's it, you should start seeing metrics appear on the newly created `otel-s3m-example` collector.
